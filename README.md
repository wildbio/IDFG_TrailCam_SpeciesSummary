# IDFG_TrailCam_SpeciesSummary

Idaho Fish and Game (IDFG) deploys hundreds of trail cameras each year for wildlife population estimates and monitoring. These cameras capture 10+ million photos each sampling season. This R Shiny app summarizes and prints automated reports of wildlife species occurrence data from IDFG cameras after the photos have undergone intensive species identification and other data collection.
